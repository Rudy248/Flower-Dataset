# Flower Classification Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of flower images used for training and testing machine learning models in image classification tasks.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **160 images** of flowers, divided into **7 classes**. Each class represents a different type of flower, and the images are labeled accordingly. The dataset can be used for supervised learning tasks, including classification using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, Random Forest, and more.

### Classes:
1. **Class 1**: (Callas)
2. **Class 2**: (Carnation)
3. **Class 3**: (Rose)
4. **Class 4**: (Tulip)
5. **Class 5**: (Lily)
6. **Class 6**: (Tulip)
7. **Class 7**: (Orchid)

### Dataset Structure:
- The dataset is divided into directories, each representing a flower class.
- Each directory contains multiple images of the corresponding flower class.
